== Synthesizer Patch Configuration

Patches define the complete configuration of the synthesizer, including voice settings, envelopes, LFOs, filters, mixer, effects, and routing. The patch structure is defined by the 
lw_patch.json
 schema.

=== Voice Configuration

Each patch contains 8 voices, each with:

- soundbank_index: Selects wavetable (0-9) or noise (255)
- glide: Enables pitch glide
- glide_rate: Controls glide speed
- detune: Semitone detuning
- freq_detune: Frequency detuning in Hz

=== Envelope Configuration

Eight ADSR envelopes control sound shaping:

- attack_time: Attack time in samples
- decay_time: Decay time in samples
- release_time: Release time in samples
- sustain_level: Sustain level percentage (0-100)

=== Low Frequency Oscillators (LFOs)

Four LFOs provide modulation:

- soundbank_index: Wavetable selection (0-9)
- time: Modulation rate/frequency

=== Filter Configuration

Global filter settings:

- cutoff_frequency: Filter cutoff (0-65535)
- resonance: Filter resonance (0-65535)
- kind_of_filter: Filter type ('low', 'high', 'band', 'notch')
- enabled: Enable/disable filter

=== Mixer Configuration

Controls output levels:

- gain_voices: Per-voice gain (0-100)
- gain_main: Main output gain (0-100)

=== Effects Configuration

- Overdrive: Distortion with threshold, type ('Soft', 'Hard', 'Softer'), and enable flag
- Bitcrunch: 8-bit style bit reduction effect

=== Routing Configuration

Manages signal flow:

- voices_to_envelop: Voice-to-envelope mapping
- lfo_to_voice: LFO-to-voice routing with enable flags
- lfo_to_filter: LFO #0 modulates filter cutoff
- lfo_to_freq: LFO #0 modulates oscillator frequencies
- lfo_to_freq_amount: Amount of frequency modulation in Hz

=== Synthesizer Mode

Sets polyphony mode:

mode: 'Mono', 'BiPoly', 'QuadPoly', or 'OctoPoly'

* **Mono** (`mode: 1`): Only one voice is active at a time. You can use up to 8 oscillator per voice. Creating for instance an insane SuperSaw.

* **BiPoly** (`mode: 2`): Two voices can be active at any time. You can use up to 4 oscillator per voice. 

* **QuadPoly** (`mode: 3`): Four voices can be active at any time. You can use up to 2 oscillator per voice. 

* **OctoPoly** (`mode: 4`): Eight voices can be active at any time. You can use only use 1 oscillator per voice. 

The mode affects how many voices are allocated and how the voices are configured. The voices are distributed across the available voice slots in a round-robin fashion.
